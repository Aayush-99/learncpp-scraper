# learncpp-scraper
www.learncpp.com is one of the best resources to learn C++ out there. It has all the content you'll ever need while studying C++.
They don't have an ebook or pdf for the same. So I wrote this simple web scraper which would download all the webpages from the website, which you can then convert to pdf easily. I would have uploaded the final pdf itself, but it would then face copyright issues.
Ensure that you have the required packages installed as listed in the requirements.txt file and then simply run the python script. All the webpages will be downloaded in nearly 45 minutes. 

Hope it helps anyone in need for offline learncpp.com resources.
